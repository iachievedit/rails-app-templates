# rails-app-templates

I needed some blank "templates" of Rails apps so I could remember what steps to take adding Devise or ActiveAdmin or what have you!

## assetlemur

Every asset tracking program has to be named after an animal.  Asset Tiger, Asset Panda.  So I give you Asset Lemur.

The main branch of assetlemur was created with `rails new assetlemur` and has no modifications.  That is no controllers, no models, no nothing.
